#### About the hackathon
How can we make sure that all of the energy that is used in the Netherlands is 100% sustainable?
Custom solutions, data and technology can be a solution here. Enpuls and Enexis Netbeheer cooperate with TU Eindhoven, Microsoft, TNO, FAN, UtrechtInc, 80 hackers and innovators to come with innovative solutions to three challenges: *Flexible Energy*, *Durable Urban Development* and *Durable Mobility*.

#### Our idea: Sonnet
We developed a product called Sonnet, which is a solar panel prediction system that can help prevent and reduce station failure. We have built the following features:

*Solar panel database*<br>
We have built a big database containing solar panel data. We have enriched an existing registration of solar panels by detecting non-registered solar panels in aerial photography (Open Data NL) with a deep neural network.

*Demographic database*<br>
We have also created a database with prognostic demographic data based on existing demographic data on a district level. We predicted the demographics per district for the upcoming 10 years. We also added the average roof quality per district by scraping the [ZonAtlas](http://www.zonatlas.nl/home/), which tells you whether your roof is suitable for solar panels.

*Solar panel forecast*<br>
We combine the two databases to predict solar panel growth on a disctrict level.

*Station capacity forecast*<br>
Finally, we can combine all these effort into a product that shows if a station is prone to failure by comparing the predicted net capacity used by solar panels in a certain district and the available capacity in the district stations.
